    "The data in the dataset is from a real Czech bank from 1999. The data is about clients and their accounts and has relation account, client, disposiiton,permanent order, transaction, loan, credit card and demographic data. Relations 'loans' and 'credit card' describe some services which bank offers to its clients. More credit cards can be issued to an account but atmost one loan can be granted for an account. The business objective is to analyze the transactional behavior of the customers and predict the loan approval status for the same customers.This is useful in cases where credit card companies provide pre approved loans for customers based on their payment and other factors. To acheive this, the below mentioned steps are followed:\n",
